- Week 1st: *Member*: tdvanh, nthien, nvanh join the meeting
  + Content:
    * Reseaching the basic of shell
    * Find solution to implement this program
    * Build the main structure of the project
    * Divive feature:
      . globbing
      . path_expansions
      . history
      . command_substitution
      . logical_operators
      . exit
      . signal
  + Report:
    * Understand some feature of the shell
    * Finish a basic part of globbing, history and path_expansions

- Week 2nd: *Member*: tdvanh, nthien join the meeting

Strategy to understand the code base:

Discuss the solution and the algorithms together
Clearly explain each member ideas
Agree on one coding style, solution a algorithm
Immediately ask for code lines we don't understand
